    lyrics: `Verse 1
Praise the king of Glory, He is God alone,
Praise Him for the wonders He to us hath shown;
For His promised presence, All the pilgrim way,
For the flaming pillar, And the cloud by day.

Chorus

Praise ?. Him, shining angels,
Strike .? your harps of gold,
All .? His hosts adore Him,
Who .? His face behold;
Through .? His great dominion,
While .? the ages roll,
All His works shall praise Him (3ce)
Bless the Lord, my soul!

Verse 2

Praise Him for redemption, Free to every soul;
Praise Him for the Fountain That can make us whole;
For His gifts of kindness, And His loving care,
For the blest assurance, That He answers prayer.

Chorus

Praise ?. Him, shining angels,
Strike .? your harps of gold,
All .? His hosts adore Him,
Who .? His face behold;
Through .? His great dominion,
While .? the ages roll,
All His works shall praise Him (3ce)
Bless the Lord, my soul!

Verse 3

Praise Him for the trials, Sent as chords of love,
Binding us more closely, To the things above;
For the faith that conquers, Hope, that naught can dim,
For the land where loved ones, Gather unto Him.

Chorus

Praise ?. Him, shining angels,
Strike .? your harps of gold,
All .? His hosts adore Him,
Who .? His face behold;
Through .? His great dominion,
While .? the ages roll,
All His works shall praise Him (3ce)
Bless the Lord, my soul!`,

    lyrics: `1.
Praise my soul, the King of heaven,
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Evermore His praises sing,

Chr.Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the Everlasting King.

2.
Praise Him for His grace and favour
To our father in distress;
Praise Him, still the same for ever,
Slow to chide and swift to bless

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Glorious in His Faithfulness

3.
Father like, He tends and spares us,
Well our feeble frame he knows;
In His Hands He gently bears us.
Rescues us from all our foes;

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Widely yet His mercy flows.

4.
Angel in the height adores Him!
Ye behold Him face to face
Saints triumphant, bow before Him,
Gathered in from every race:

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise, with us the God of grace.
Amen.

    lyrics: `
    HOLY holy holy Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;    
Holy, holy, holy merciful and mighty,
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee
Which wert and art, and evermore shalt be

Holy, holy, holy! Through the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see
Only thou art holy; there is none beside Thee;
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise
Thy name in earth and sky and sea
Holy, holy, holy merciful and mighty,
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!.
